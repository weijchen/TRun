- Round 3 Team Project in CMU ETC BVW (Build Virtual World)
- Assigned Theme: A Fun-Focus Virtual World in a Week
- Project Duration: 1 weeks (Oct. 6, 2021 - Oct. 13, 2021)
- Tools: Unity3D, Tobii Eye Tracker
- Platform: PC game / Tobii Eye Tracker
- Team members:

- Introduction: The game is inspired by TRON and other endless running games (Temple Run, Subway Surfers). Also, we try to incorporate cyberpunk style and theme into the game. Eventually, we create a racing game where the player rides a cyber motorcycle through jumps platforms and tracks. To enhance the playing experience, we utilize different angles and perspectives of the camera and polish the motorcycle model with particle systems and complex movement behaviors. The goal of this game is to finish the track with higher scores (with diamond-shaped collectibles) and with a faster finish time.

# Notable Contributions
1. Implemented the player controller and adjusted physics reactions for the cyber motorcycle on Tobii Eye Tracker 5 with Unity SDK
2. Responsible for the level design of a three-stage scene, including the racing track and collectibles
3. Collaborated with artists on the arrangement of interactable objects in the game (collectibles, respawn points, user interface, and dead zone)
